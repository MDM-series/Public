This example shows that when reconstrcting the pressure distribution in homogeneous medium, the step size can be chosen as large as the 
propagation distance. Results in this example are compared with the results in 
<a href="https://m-sound.github.io/mSOUND/FSMDM_3D_multi_sources">
Reconstruction of the source pressure distribution with FSMDM in a 3D homogeneous medium</a>, in which a smaller step size is used. 
Simulation step up are very similar in these two examples.

<!---defining the structure grid--->
<h6>Generating the grid structure to define the computational domain</h6>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
We first need to define the temporal and spatial computational domains in 3D forward simulations. 
In FSMDM, any arbitrary values can be set for the time step and temporal domain size, since they are not being used. 
Here, we set them to 0.
 <pre>
<code>      
dx = 1.8750e-04;  <font color="#03a852"> % step size in the x direction [m]</font> 
dy = 1.8750e-04;  <font color="#03a852"> % step size in the y direction [m]</font> 
dz = 0.0210;      <font color="#03a852"> % step size in the z direction [m]</font> 

x_length = 0.0900;  <font color="#03a852"> % computational domain size in the x direction [m]</font> 
y_length = 0.0900;  <font color="#03a852"> % computational domain size in the y direction [m]</font> 
z_length = 0.0210;  <font color="#03a852"> % computational domain size in the z direction [m]</font> 
    
mgrid = set_grid(0, 0, dx, x_length, dy, y_length, dz, z_length);              
</code>

<!---3D forward simulation--->
<h6>3D forward simulation</h6>
<hr>
<p>
 <br>The pressure field on a plane 21 mm away from the source plane is first calculated with the function 
  <a href="/mSOUND/function.html#Forward3D_fund">Forward3D_fund</a>. In this example, the spatial aliasing errors
  are reduced by increasing the transverse domain size, while in the example <a href="https://m-sound.github.io/mSOUND/FSMDM_3D_multi_sources">
Reconstruction of the source pressure distribution with FSMDM in a 3D homogeneous medium</a>, absorbing layers are used. The reason 
we choose to increase the domain size here is because, in the one-step reconstruction/projection case, the absorption layer is not effective anymore. The absorption layer can 
 only be modeled accurately by marching the wave field step-by-step in the z-direction (3D) or y-direction (2D). 
<pre> <code>
omega_c = 2*pi*fc;
reflection_order = 0;
<font color="#03a852">% forward propagation </font>   
p = Forward3D_fund(mgrid, medium, source_p, omega_c, reflection_order); 
</code> </pre>            
</p>

<!---3D backward simulation--->
<h6>Reconstruction</h6>
<hr>
<p>
 <br>The source plane pressure distribution is obtained with the function 
  <a href="/mSOUND/function.html#Backward3D_fund">Backward3D_fund</a>.
<pre> <code>
source_p = p(:,:,end);
<font color="#03a852">% backward propagation </font>   
p = Backward3D_fund(mgrid, medium, source_p, omega_c, reflection_order); 
</code> </pre>    


The figure below was generated with the one-step recostruction method and it shows (a) ground-truth pressure distribution, 
(b) pressure distribution on the xy plane 21 mm away from the source plane and (c) the reconstructed source plane pressure distribution.
